          I had worked along with Jane during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development.

            If you enjoy sharing knowledge, you could consider teaching coding or mentoring new developers entering the industry. 
            If you like the fast-paced environment, you could look into joining a startup where your diverse skill set could make a big impact. 
            Or, you could even consider starting your own venture!

            Your sales experience and technical know-how could make you a strong candidate for a product management role. 
            You'd bridge the gap between business and technology, guiding products from conception to launch.
